## Business Problem

Describe the **real-world business or community problem** your project addresses.

<!-- > *Example:*   -->
> Navigating the vast world of music to find a playlist that matches our exact mood can be a surprisingly frustrating chore. The paradox of choice on platforms like Spotify often leads to decision fatigue, pulling us out of the moment instead of enhancing it. 

> Moodsic is an interactive web application designed to solve this. It intelligently matches the users‚Äô current mood, personality traits, and even the weather to personalized playlists by analyzing a unique blend of inputs. By removing the burden of choice, Moodsic creates a more intuitive, enjoyable, and emotionally-connected music listening experience.

### 3) Backend / Cloud Service Setup

#### Firebase
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Create a new project.
3. Enable the following:
   - **Authentication** ‚Üí Email/Password sign-in

4. Copy the Firebase configuration into your `.env` file.

<!-- #### Optional: Express.js / MongoDB
If your app includes a backend:
1. Create a `/server` folder for backend code.
2. Inside `/server`, create a `.env` file with:
   ```bash
   MONGO_URI=<your_mongodb_connection_string>
   JWT_SECRET=<your_jwt_secret_key>
   ``` -->
3. Start the backend:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

---

### 4) Run the Frontend
To start the development server:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```
The project will run on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) by default.

<!-- To build and preview the production version:
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
``` -->

---

### 5) Testing the Application

#### Manual Testing
Perform the following checks before submission:

| Area | Test Description | Expected Outcome |
|:--|:--|:--|

## Group Reflection

Each member should contribute 2‚Äì3 sentences on their learning and project experience.

> - Adilah: This project has challenged my coding and teamwork skills while introducing me to new technologies that make websites visually engaging. Creating charts was a new experience for me, and I quickly learned how important it is to balance technical implementation with clear and appealing design. Collaborating with my team enhanced my communication and time management abilities, as we combined our strengths to bring the project to life. Overall, I‚Äôm proud of what we accomplished and excited to continue improving my development skills. 

> - Eryn: I gained practical experience working with real-world frameworks and authentication systems. I discovered how APIs function in production settings, including the challenges of permissions and paid access. One major challenge was handling Spotify‚Äôs authentication and token flow, which I resolved through documentation study and iterative testing. Collaborating closely with the frontend team improved my communication and project management skills, while reinforcing the importance of structured problem-solving and teamwork in a development environment.

> - Aaliya: Making the backend using Firebase has been an amazing experience as it simplified the authentication and data storage process. The seamless integration with services like Firestore allowed for real-time updates and quick deployment. It gave me a deeper understanding of cloud-based solutions and how easily they can scale to meet user demands. 

> - Sreya: By sharing my word cloud designs with my group mates and getting their feedback, I could design the word cloud feature so that it matched the theme of the application better, and make it more usable for the users as well. I also explored different libraries like D3.js and other frameworks like Tailwind. Although I did not use them, it was a good opportunity to learn about the available resources. All in all, this learning experience has definitely been valuable, and has reinforced my learning in this module.

> - Kushala: As the Frontend Developer and UI/UX Designer for Moodsic, I learned how to transform creative ideas into interactive, user-friendly interfaces that seamlessly blend emotion and music. Building features like Song of the Day taught me how to balance aesthetics with usability, making every click and effect feel intentional. Through continuous testing and feedback, I strengthened my skills in visual design and user-centered thinking. It was very rewarding seeing our vision come to life.

> - Etienne: Managing to complete the personality quiz using HTML and JavaScript was a rewarding challenge, as I had to ensure it was both interactive and user-friendly. Converting it to React.js afterward was an exciting next step, as it allowed me to leverage components and state management for a more dynamic and maintainable application. This experience deepened my understanding of front-end development and the power of React in building scalable web applications.
 

As a team, reflect on:
- Key takeaways from working with real-world frameworks  
- Challenges faced and how they were resolved  
- Insights on teamwork, project management, and problem-solving 

> - As a team, working with real-world frameworks like React, Firebase, and Chart.js gave us valuable experience to build a functional and interactive website. We quickly learned the importance of choosing the right framework for specific tasks, such as using React for state management and Firebase for backend services. The frameworks helped streamline our workflow and kept the code organized, making it easier to scale and maintain the project as it progressed. A key takeaway was realizing how powerful and time-saving these frameworks can be when used correctly, but also how they require a solid understanding of their core concepts to avoid issues down the road.

> - Throughout the project, we encountered challenges such as integrating multiple libraries, managing complex states, and ensuring cross-component compatibility. These were resolved through strong communication and collaborative problem-solving. For example, we divided tasks effectively and regularly checked in with each other to ensure we were aligned. In terms of teamwork, we learned the value of trust and constructive feedback, with everyone contributing their strengths and being open to suggestions. Project management skills were crucial in keeping us on track, with clear deadlines and responsibility sharing helping us stay organized and meet milestones.









<!-- open 2 terminals, run:
cd backend
npm install
# create .env from .env.example
cp .env.example .env
then fill in the keys 

cd frontend
npm install

**to run our app, must start both backend/frontend:
in backend directory: 
npm start

in frontend directory: 
npm start

** impt **
Do not commit .env ‚Äî it contains spotify secret keys.
(i alr put in .gitignore but do check b4 u push)
Only commit code and .env.example.

open legacy folder to use mamp/wamp
for react-app, after npm start for both front/backend, should be able to see at localhost:3000 -->
